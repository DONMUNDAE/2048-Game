# 2048-Game
Purpose:
The purpose of the project seems to be to implement the game 2048 in C++. The game involves moving tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. It's a popular puzzle game that requires strategy and planning.

Main Features:

Game Mechanics: The game mechanics involve moving tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right, by pressing the corresponding keys ('w', 's', 'a', 'd').
Tile Addition: Tiles with the same value can be combined when moved in a direction, and their values are added up. For example, if two tiles with the number 2 are combined, they form a single tile with the number 4.
Random Tile Generation: After each move, a new tile (with a value of 2) is randomly added to the grid.
Winning and Losing Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions when a tile with the number 2048 is reached. It also checks for losing conditions when there are no empty spaces on the grid and no possible moves left.
Overall, this project provides a functional implementation of the game 2048 in C++, but there are opportunities for further refinement and enhancement.
